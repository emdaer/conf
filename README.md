## Deployments

## Website
Travis autodeploys the website to GitHub Pages using its `deploy` configuration when changes are merged into the `site` branch. Being an [Organization Page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/), the website code is stored on the `master` branch.

## Pull Requests
Pull Request builds will run [surge-review](https://github.com/cdaringe/surge-review) via Travis&#8217; `after_success`  hook on the highest node version build using [travis-deploy-once](https://github.com/semantic-release/travis-deploy-once). Once the deployment is sucessful, a comment from emdaerbot will be posted to the respective PR with a link to the built site. This can be used for design review and functional testing of Pull Requests. Each additional commit to the PR will rebuild the site and post a new link.
